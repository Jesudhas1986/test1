 Possible Causes:
1. Node Affinity Mismatch
Your pod has this in its YAML:

yaml
Copy
Edit
affinity:
  nodeAffinity:
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
            - key: zone
              operator: In
              values:
                - us-east
‚û°Ô∏è But none of the 120 nodes have the label: zone=us-east.

‚úÖ Fix: Either:

Add the required label to at least one node:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc label node <node-name> zone=us-east
Or update the pod‚Äôs affinity rule to match existing node labels.

2. Pod Selector Mismatch (Pod Affinity/Anti-Affinity)
Example:

yaml
Copy
Edit
affinity:
  podAffinity:
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - labelSelector:
          matchLabels:
            app: my-app
        topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/hostname"
‚û°Ô∏è But no existing pods match app: my-app, so this pod can't be placed near them.

‚úÖ Fix:

Make sure matching pods already exist.

Or switch to preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution if strict co-location isn't needed.

3. Preemption Blocked
You may be using a priorityClassName with preemptionPolicy: Never, which prevents evicting lower-priority pods to make room.

‚úÖ Fix:

Allow preemption if needed:

yaml
Copy
Edit
priorityClassName: high-priority
preemptionPolicy: PreemptLowerPriority  # (default)
‚úÖ How to Troubleshoot Exactly
Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
oc describe pod <pod-name>
Look under Events ‚Äì you‚Äôll see messages like:

rust
Copy
Edit
0/120 nodes are available: 120 didn't match pod affinity/selector.
Or more detailed errors like:

"node(s) didn't match node affinity/selector"

"node(s) had taints that the pod didn't tolerate"

"node(s) didn't have enough memory/cpu"

üìå Summary Fix Checklist
Issue	Fix
Affinity label mismatch	Add missing labels to nodes or update pod affinity
Pod selector mismatch	Adjust matchLabels or ensure matching pods exist
Preemption blocked	Enable PreemptLowerPriority
Too strict affinity	Use preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution instead of required
