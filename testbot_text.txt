❌ No, Buildbot 2.6 is not compatible with Python 3.11.

Here’s why — and what you can safely do instead 👇

⚠️ Why Buildbot 2.6 won’t work with Python 3.11
Reason	Details
Python support cutoff	Buildbot 2.6.x was released in 2020 – early 2021, when the latest Python officially supported was 3.8.
Deprecated APIs	Internal dependencies (Twisted, SQLAlchemy, Jinja2 templates, etc.) in 2.6 use modules and functions removed or changed in Python 3.10 → 3.11.
Runtime errors	Users who tried running 2.x on 3.10+ reported import errors (asyncio, twisted.internet.defer), string encoding issues, and broken worker-master communication.
No security or bug fixes	Buildbot 2.x is end-of-life; only 3.x and later receive updates or Python 3.11 testing.
✅ What you should do instead
Goal	Recommended Action
Keep existing configuration	Upgrade to Buildbot 3.9 or newer, which is API-compatible and supports Python 3.11.
Minimum change upgrade path	pip install "buildbot[bundle]>=3.9,<4.0"
Want current stable release (Nov 2025)	Install Buildbot 5.4.0 (works with Python 3.11 and 3.12)

In short:

🧩 Buildbot 2.6 cannot run on Python 3.11.
You need Buildbot ≥ 3.9 for stable, tested Python 3.11 support.

Would you like me to show you the step-by-step upgrade process from 2.6 → 3.9 (keeping your existing configs and database)?
