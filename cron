In OpenShift, a CronJob always runs inside a container using a service account and the permissions granted to it. It does not run as the OpenShift CLI user you are logged in as.

But if your goal is to make the CronJob run with the same user identity / permissions as your current login, here’s what you can do:

1. Log in with your OpenShift user
oc login <cluster-api-url> -u <your-username> -p <your-password>

2. Switch to the correct project/namespace
oc project <your-namespace>

3. Create a CronJob YAML

For example:

apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: my-cronjob
spec:
  schedule: "*/5 * * * *"   # every 5 minutes
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          serviceAccountName: default   # <-- runs with default service account unless changed
          containers:
          - name: my-job
            image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi
            command: ["echo", "Hello from CronJob"]
          restartPolicy: OnFailure

4. Make the CronJob run as your user’s permissions

OpenShift users don’t map directly to Linux users, but you can make the CronJob run with your OpenShift user’s access rights by:

Using your project/namespace → The job will run under the permissions your user has in that project.

Binding a Role/ClusterRole to the ServiceAccount used by the CronJob.
Example:

oc create rolebinding my-cronjob-rb \
  --clusterrole=edit \
  --serviceaccount=<your-namespace>:default \
  --namespace=<your-namespace>


This makes the CronJob’s service account have the same level of access (edit, admin, etc.) as you do in that project.

✅ Key point:
The CronJob does not directly inherit your login session. Instead, you make its service account have equivalent permissions to your user in the project where you logged in.

Do you want me to show you a working YAML example of a CronJob that runs with the same access as your logged-in user (like oc whoami)?
