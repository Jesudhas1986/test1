heck Splunk internal logs

On the Splunk server, look at:

$SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/splunkd.log


Search for HttpInputDataHandler or HttpInputServer errors.

Check HEC health endpoint

Run:

curl -k https://<splunk-host>:8088/services/collector/health


You should get a JSON response like:

{"text":"HEC is healthy","code":0}


Verify token & headers

Use a minimal working curl test with your HEC token:

curl -k https://<splunk-host>:8088/services/collector \
  -H "Authorization: Splunk <your-token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"event":"hello"}'
