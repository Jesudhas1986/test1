can I send it to /tmp directory in master
ChatGPT said:

Yes ✅ — you can upload files from a worker to the /tmp directory on the master in Buildbot.

Just make sure that:

The user running the Buildbot master process has write permission to /tmp.

You provide the absolute path in masterdest.

Example
from buildbot.plugins import steps, util

f = util.BuildFactory()

f.addStep(steps.FileUpload(
    workersrc="build/output.tar.gz",    # file created on worker
    masterdest="/tmp/output.tar.gz"     # absolute path on master
))


This will take output.tar.gz from the worker and place it into /tmp on the master machine.

⚠️ Caution:

Files in /tmp may be deleted automatically (e.g., after reboot or by cleanup jobs).

For permanent artifacts, it’s better to use a dedicated directory inside your Buildbot master (like ~/buildbot/artifacts/).

👉 Do you want me to also show you how to serve that uploaded file via the Buildbot web UI (so you can download it easily)?

can you copy directory 
ChatGPT said:

Yes 👍 — in Buildbot you can copy a whole directory from a worker → master (or the other way) using the same FileUpload / FileDownload steps.

But there’s a trick: these steps transfer files, not directories.
So to transfer a directory, you normally:

Archive it on the worker (tar or zip it).

Upload the archive to the master.

(Optionally) extract it on the master.

🔹 Example: Worker → Master (copy directory)
from buildbot.plugins import steps, util

f = util.BuildFactory()

# Step 1: Pack directory on worker
f.addStep(steps.ShellCommand(
    command=["tar", "-czf", "mydir.tar.gz", "mydir"]
))

# Step 2: Upload to master
f.addStep(steps.FileUpload(
    workersrc="mydir.tar.gz",
    masterdest="/tmp/mydir.tar.gz"
))

# Step 3 (optional): Extract on master
f.addStep(steps.MasterShellCommand(
    command=["tar", "-xzf", "/tmp/mydir.tar.gz", "-C", "/tmp/"]
))

🔹 Example: Master → Worker (copy directory)
from buildbot.plugins import steps, util

f = util.BuildFactory()

# Step 1: Pack directory on master
f.addStep(steps.MasterShellCommand(
    command=["tar", "-czf", "/tmp/configs.tar.gz", "-C", "/etc/", "configs"]
))

# Step 2: Download to worker
f.addStep(steps.FileDownload(
    mastersrc="/tmp/configs.tar.gz",
    workerdest="configs.tar.gz"
))

# Step 3: Extract on worker
f.addStep(steps.ShellCommand(
    command=["tar", "-xzf", "configs.tar.gz"]
))


✅ This way, you effectively “copy” entire directories between worker and master.

Do you want me to show you a generic helper step (like a reusable Python function) that takes a directory name and automatically handles tar + upload + untar?
