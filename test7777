Create or update a Pull Request

If you want the original PR author’s branch updated: you usually cannot push to their branch unless given write access. Instead:

Open a PR from yourname/pr-NN-upstream → upstream:target-branch (create a new PR) OR

On GitHub, comment in the original PR explaining you created a replacement branch and link it.

If you want the upstream PR owner to include your changes, you can open a new PR or ask them to pull from your branch.
