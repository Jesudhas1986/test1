Testing and User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
Overview

The Testing and UAT phase ensures that the application deployed on OpenShift functions correctly, meets business requirements, and is ready for production. It validates both technical functionality and business workflows in an environment that closely mirrors production.

Objectives

Validate end-to-end application functionality.

Confirm integration with external services and databases.

Identify and resolve defects before production deployment.

Obtain formal approval from business users and stakeholders.

Verify performance, scalability, and security readiness.

Process

Functional Testing: Execute test cases to verify application behavior, APIs, and UI.

Integration Testing: Validate communication between microservices, databases, and third-party services.

Performance Testing: Conduct load, stress, and scalability testing to ensure response times and resource usage meet SLAs.

Security Testing: Verify access controls, secrets management, and container security.

User Acceptance Testing: Business users perform real-world scenarios and workflows, providing feedback and approval.

Deliverables

Test plans, execution reports, and defect logs.

Performance test summary and metrics.

Security validation reports.

UAT sign-off from business stakeholders.

2. Handover
Overview

The Handover phase transitions the application and its supporting infrastructure from the implementation team to the operations/support team. This ensures that the production environment is managed effectively and the operations team has all the necessary knowledge and documentation.

Objectives

Transfer operational responsibility to the production support team.

Ensure complete documentation of application, infrastructure, and deployment processes.

Provide knowledge transfer on monitoring, backup, and troubleshooting.

Establish clear roles, responsibilities, and escalation procedures.

Process

Documentation Handover: Provide detailed runbooks, deployment guides, monitoring dashboards, and troubleshooting steps.

Knowledge Transfer Sessions: Conduct sessions with support teams to explain system architecture, CI/CD pipelines, configurations, and operational tasks.

Access and Permissions: Grant appropriate access to OpenShift projects, registries, and monitoring tools.

Validation: Support team performs test deployments and operational checks to ensure readiness.

Deliverables

Complete operations and deployment documentation.

Access credentials and environment inventories.

Knowledge transfer sign-off.

Operational readiness checklist.

3. Go-Live
Overview

The Go-Live phase is the official deployment of the application into the production OpenShift environment. It marks the transition from development and testing to real-world operation and business use.

Objectives

Deploy the application in production safely and reliably.

Ensure high availability, performance, and security.

Minimize downtime and operational risks during deployment.

Monitor application and platform stability post-deployment.

Process

Final Validation: Confirm infrastructure, services, and dependencies are production-ready.

Deployment: Use CI/CD pipelines or OpenShift deployment manifests to deploy the application.

Verification: Conduct smoke tests to validate application functionality and endpoints.

Monitoring: Observe system metrics, logs, and alerts to ensure stability.

Incident Management: Activate support team for immediate response to any issues.

Deliverables

Production deployment checklist.

Smoke test reports and post-deployment validation.

Monitoring dashboards and alert configurations.

Go-Live sign-off from stakeholders.

Summary

These three phases—Testing & UAT, Handover, and Go-Live—form the critical path to ensure that applications deployed on OpenShift are stable, functional, and production-ready.
They provide a structured approach to validating performance, transferring operational knowledge, and executing a controlled production deployment, ensuring business continuity and operational excellence.

If you want, I can also combine these three phases into a single visual flow diagram showing the sequential progression from UAT → Handover → Go-Live, which is very effective for documentation and presentations.

Do you want me to create that diagram?
