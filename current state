he Current State Analysis phase involves a thorough assessment of the existing application, infrastructure, and processes to understand their architecture, dependencies, performance, and limitations.
The Refactoring Identification step uses this analysis to determine areas in the code, configuration, and deployment practices that need modification to optimize for containerization, cloud-native deployment, and OpenShift orchestration.

This phase ensures that modernization or migration efforts are informed, systematic, and risk-mitigated.

1. Objectives

Document the current architecture, codebase, dependencies, and deployment environment.

Identify technical debt, performance bottlenecks, and tightly coupled components.

Evaluate compatibility with containerization and OpenShift deployment standards.

Determine refactoring requirements to improve scalability, maintainability, and cloud readiness.

Establish a roadmap for modernization and containerization.
