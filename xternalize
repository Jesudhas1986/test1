xternalize Configuration Phase
Overview

The Externalize Configuration phase focuses on decoupling application configuration from the codebase and moving it into external, environment-specific stores.
This approach is a key principle of 12-factor applications and is critical for containerized deployments on OpenShift, enabling portability, maintainability, and security across development, testing, and production environments.

Externalizing configuration ensures that the same container image can be deployed in multiple environments without code changes, simply by altering configuration values.

1. Objectives

Separate configuration data from application code.

Enable environment-specific settings (dev, QA, staging, production) without modifying code.

Secure sensitive information such as database credentials, API keys, and certificates.

Facilitate CI/CD pipeline integration for automated deployments.

Improve maintainability and reduce deployment errors.
