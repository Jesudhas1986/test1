Great! Below is a ready‚Äëto‚Äëuse sample Deployment and Service YAML that will run your gRPC server in plaintext (no TLS) inside OpenShift and expose it so you (or your admin) can route to it.

‚úÖ 1. Deployment (no TLS in your app)
Make sure your gRPC app inside the container listens on port 50051 with no TLS (as shown in previous code examples).

yaml
Copy
Edit
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: grpc-server
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: grpc-server
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: grpc-server
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: grpc-server
        image: <your-grpc-server-image>
        ports:
        - containerPort: 50051
Replace <your-grpc-server-image> with your built image.

‚úÖ 2. Service (NodePort or LoadBalancer)
üëâ If your cluster allows LoadBalancer (cloud providers):
yaml
Copy
Edit
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: grpc-server-svc
spec:
  selector:
    app: grpc-server
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 50051
    targetPort: 50051
  type: LoadBalancer
After applying this, ask your admin for the EXTERNAL-IP of this service:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
oc get svc grpc-server-svc
Then you can connect to:

arduino
Copy
Edit
EXTERNAL-IP:50051
üëâ If your cluster does not support LoadBalancer, use NodePort:
yaml
Copy
Edit
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: grpc-server-svc
spec:
  selector:
    app: grpc-server
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 50051
    targetPort: 50051
    nodePort: 30051   # pick a free port in 30000-32767
  type: NodePort
After applying this, you need a node‚Äôs hostname/IP:

makefile
Copy
Edit
<NodeHostname>:30051
Since you said you can‚Äôt run node commands, ask your admin:

‚ÄúWhat hostname or IP can I use to reach NodePort services in our OpenShift cluster?‚Äù

‚ö†Ô∏è Important notes
OpenShift Routes are HTTP-based and don‚Äôt work for raw gRPC plaintext (they require HTTP/2 with TLS). So stick to NodePort or LoadBalancer.

TLS is not forced by OpenShift. If your gRPC server is configured without certificates, it will speak plaintext.

‚úÖ Next steps for you
Apply the above Deployment and Service YAML (oc apply -f deployment.yaml and oc apply -f service.yaml).

Ask your OpenShift admin:

If LoadBalancer is supported, what‚Äôs the EXTERNAL-IP?

If NodePort is used, what hostname should you use?

If you‚Äôd like, I can also help you:
‚úÖ generate these YAMLs with your exact image name and labels,
‚úÖ or draft a mail/Slack message to your admin asking for the external hostname.
