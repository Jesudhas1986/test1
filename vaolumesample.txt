give me steps to implement volume in a deployment config file that uses only httpd from registry

Thought for 10s

Nice ‚Äî here‚Äôs a focused, copy-pasteable guide to adding a volume to an OpenShift DeploymentConfig that runs the official httpd image from a registry (no custom image builds). I‚Äôll show a PersistentVolumeClaim example (most common), plus a quick emptyDir and ConfigMap variant so you can pick what you need.

1) Plan

We will run the public httpd:2.4 image.

Mount a volume into the container at /usr/local/apache2/htdocs (default httpd document root for the official httpd image).

Option A: use a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) ‚Äî recommended for persistent content.

Option B: use emptyDir ‚Äî ephemeral (deleted when Pod dies).

Option C: mount a ConfigMap for static files (small site content).

2) Create a PVC (persistent storage) ‚Äî manifests & command

Save as pvc-httpd.yaml:

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: httpd-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 2Gi
  storageClassName: ""   # optional: set your storageClass or leave blank to use default


Apply:

oc apply -f pvc-httpd.yaml


Check:

oc get pvc httpd-pvc

3) DeploymentConfig with PVC mounted

Save as dc-httpd-pvc.yaml:

apiVersion: apps.openshift.io/v1
kind: DeploymentConfig
metadata:
  name: httpd-with-pvc
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    app: httpd-with-pvc
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: httpd-with-pvc
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: httpd
        image: httpd:2.4
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        volumeMounts:
        - name: www-data
          mountPath: /usr/local/apache2/htdocs
      volumes:
      - name: www-data
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: httpd-pvc
  triggers:
  - type: ConfigChange
  - type: ImageChange
    imageChangeParams:
      automatic: true
      containerNames:
      - httpd
      from:
        kind: ImageStreamTag
        name: "httpd:latest"


Apply:

oc apply -f dc-httpd-pvc.yaml


Notes:

mountPath uses the official httpd doc root.

The ImageChange trigger references an ImageStreamTag ‚Äî if you are using a plain external image (dockerhub), ImageChange trigger is optional; you can remove that trigger block if not using an ImageStream.

4) Expose service (optional)
oc expose dc/httpd-with-pvc --port=80 --name=httpd-svc
oc expose svc/httpd-svc


This creates a Route so you can browse the site.

5) Populate content into the volume

Options:

If PVC is bound to a hostPath-backed PV, you can write directly on the node (not recommended).

Use oc rsync to copy files into the pod's mounted directory:

Wait for pod to be Running: oc get pods -l app=httpd-with-pvc

Copy local files:

POD=$(oc get pods -l app=httpd-with-pvc -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
oc rsync ./my-site/ $POD:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/


Or create a temporary pod that mounts the same PVC and write files from there.

6) Verify
oc get pods -l app=httpd-with-pvc
oc logs <pod-name>
curl http://<route-hostname>   # or use oc port-forward if no route

Quick alternatives
A ‚Äî emptyDir (ephemeral)

Replace the volumes section in the DC with:

volumes:
- name: www-data
  emptyDir: {}


Use when you only need temporary runtime storage.

B ‚Äî ConfigMap for small static site content

Create a configmap from a folder:

oc create configmap httpd-site --from-file=./site-files


Mount in DC:

volumes:
- name: site
  configMap:
    name: httpd-site
volumeMounts:
- name: site
  mountPath: /usr/local/apache2/htdocs
  readOnly: true


Note: ConfigMap total size is limited and not for large assets.

Troubleshooting tips

PVC Pending ‚Üí no matching PV: check StorageClass, cluster has free PV capacity.

Files not served ‚Üí SELinux/permissions: ensure files are readable by UID used by httpd. oc rsh into pod and check permissions.

If the image runs as a random UID (OpenShift default), ensure volume permissions allow write by that UID ‚Äî use initContainers to chown the mount or create PVC with proper permission support.

Example initContainer to chown PVC (if httpd runs with random UID)

Add inside spec.template.spec containers block before main container:

initContainers:
- name: fix-permissions
  image: busybox
  command: ["sh", "-c", "chown -R 1001:0 /usr/local/apache2/htdocs || true"]
  volumeMounts:
  - name: www-data
    mountPath: /usr/local/apache2/htdocs


Adjust UID (1001) to the UID httpd runs as (OpenShift images often use non-root UIDs).

If you want, I can:

produce a single combined YAML (PVC + DC) ready to oc apply -f, or

show exact oc commands to create everything step-by-step for your cluster type, or

give an initContainer that sets SELinux labels/permissions for OpenShift specifically.

Which one do you want me to produce next? (I can just output the combined YAML now.)

You said:
can you rewrite deployment config with full registry path
ChatGPT said:

Perfect ‚Äî here‚Äôs the same DeploymentConfig rewritten to use the full registry path for the httpd image, instead of an internal ImageStreamTag.

I‚Äôll show the direct external image reference (no imagestream trigger), which is the cleanest when pulling straight from Docker Hub or another public registry.

‚úÖ Full DeploymentConfig using full registry path
apiVersion: apps.openshift.io/v1
kind: DeploymentConfig
metadata:
  name: httpd-with-pvc
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    app: httpd-with-pvc
  strategy:
    type: Rolling
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: httpd-with-pvc
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: httpd
        image: docker.io/library/httpd:2.4
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          protocol: TCP
        volumeMounts:
        - name: www-data
          mountPath: /usr/local/apache2/htdocs
      volumes:
      - name: www-data
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: httpd-pvc
  triggers:
  - type: ConfigChange

üîç What changed:

Full image path ‚Üí docker.io/library/httpd:2.4

docker.io = Docker Hub registry

library = default namespace for official images

httpd:2.4 = image name and version tag

You can replace it with your private or enterprise registry path like:

quay.io/yourorg/httpd:2.4

registry.redhat.io/rhscl/httpd-24-rhel7:latest

Removed ImageChange trigger ‚Üí since we‚Äôre directly pulling from the external registry, OpenShift won‚Äôt automatically update from imagestream changes.

üíæ Example PersistentVolumeClaim (for completeness)

Save this as pvc-httpd.yaml and apply before the DC:

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: httpd-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 2Gi

üåê Optional: Expose service and route
oc expose dc/httpd-with-pvc --port=80 --name=httpd-svc
oc expose svc/httpd-svc

‚öôÔ∏è Notes:

If your cluster requires authenticated image pulls (for private registries), create a pull secret and link it:

oc create secret docker-registry myregistrysecret \
  --docker-server=registry.example.com \
  --docker-username=myuser \
  --docker-password=mypassword \
  --docker-email=myemail@example.com

oc secrets link default myregistrysecret --for=pull


Then the image line can be, for example:
image: registry.example.com/myteam/httpd:2.4

Would you like me to include both PVC + DeploymentConfig in a single YAML file (so you can oc apply -f file.yaml once)?
